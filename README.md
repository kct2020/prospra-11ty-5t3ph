# Keith's Heading

Project notes here with original README below. Then I'll rewrite this if it works. Initially, I want to: 
- deploy to Cloudflare Pages (Deploy CP). 
- configure site basics (1st Config).
Then later:
- add PWA capabilities, including push notifications (OneSignal).
Amend this todo list as project progresses. Adding detailed notes below with latest changes first

## yymm02a Branch3

## yymmddb Branch2

## yymmdda 1st Config
Usually, I create a 1st Config branch to get a working site with config changes as per original README instructions and note files changed with any additional notes. Most of this detail is deleted from final README, but it serves to keep track of installation progress.
- author.json
- menu.json
- site.js

## 210818a Deploy CP
From now on, I'll adopt the simple license that comes with this repo.

# 11ty Netlify Jumpstart

> Created by Stephanie Eckles ([@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph))

Visit [11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/) for all the feature details - or go ahead and [generate a new repo from the template](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart/generate) to view the information locally.

## Quick Start

1. [Generate a repo from this template](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart/generate)
   which will copy this project into your own new repo _if you are currently signed in to GitHub_. Alternatively, [visit the repo directly](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart).

1. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty and other dependencies. Then run `npm start` to run both 11ty and sass in watch
   mode. Use `npm run build` to run a production version, which will also generate social share
   preview images.

1. Open `src/_data/meta.js` and adjust the values to your details.

1. Review the [styling documentation](https://5t3ph.github.io/html-sass-jumpstart/) for the included minimal
   Sass framework, particularly the theme variables, to quickly customize the starter.

1. Edit `_includes/home.njk` to change the home page - including changing the template type if desired -
   and then create content within `_pages` using any templating format you prefer to add content.

1. Check out the [About page](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/about/) for expanded details on included features of this starter.

1. Review the [11ty documentation](https://11ty.dev) to more deeply apply customizations, including
   adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.

### Is Netlify hosting required?

It's not required, but highly recommended, and is also how the build process is setup to run
against.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS and social preview image generation

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.

## Feedback welcome!

You can [file it as an issue](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-netlify-jumpstart/issues).
